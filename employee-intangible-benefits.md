# Employee Intangible Benefits

_The document may updated over time._


## Equipment Compensation


You may require compensation for any work-related equipment up to $2000 for a two-years period. Compensation will be split for 24 equal parts with monthly payments. If you leave the company earlier, the rest of payments will be held.
For instance:
1.	You buy a laptop for _$2300_
2.	A compensation coverage is $2000, so _$2300 – $2000 = $300_ above is up to you.
3.	The coverage splits to 24 months. It is _$2000 ÷ 24 = $83_ per month.
4.	Every month you get additional _$83_ for your salary.
5.	You decide to leave after 15 months. The total compensation is _$83 × 15 = $1245_. The rest _$755_ is not covered.


## Education and Conferences

The company covers your education and events spendings up to $1000 per year, including travel and accommodation. A purchase must be approved by the financial team in advance.
