# How To Ask for Support

_The document may updated over time._


_Remember:_ for security reasons the support team never interacts with you first. It only replies on your requests!


## What

First, what are issues the support team may help you with? There are several topics:
* Bugs and suspicious behavior of the system
* Booking-related issues (including force closings, but only if you can't make it by yourself in the admin panel)
* Property and location mapping issues
* Registration- and logging-related issues
* Software licenses (Google Workspaces, Microsoft Office, etc.)
* Local and personal hardware setup — by the office team
* Software setup (including Outlook) — by the office team

In opposite there are topics which are not under our responsibility: 
* Implementation of new features into the system (write to our TPMs with such requests)


## How

There are some rules how to make a good request:
* The one and only method to contact the support is a message on `support@happytravel.com` 
* DO check if you can solve an issue by yourself before you'll write a request. Sometimes a five-minute googling helps faster than a day-long waiting for a TeamViewer session. That is true for general software questions, like Outlook filtering, program setup and so on.
* This is a group address, so DO NOT set any personal addresses in copy
* DO NOT use messengers to make a request. That's simple: if your request isn't registered, it has no commitments to be done.
* DO NOT copy support for non-related messages
* DO use clear subject in your requests:
```
❌ 'Booking issues' — bad, requires a roundtrip for booking details
✔️ 'Booking HTL-AE-000001-01 stuck at status Created' — good, details at place
```
* DO NOT overuse words like 'Urgent' in subject
```
❌ 'URGENT: Issues with a Booking with a cancellation date in six months ahead' — bad
✔️ 'URGENT: Issues with a Booking with a cancellation date tomorrow' — good, the case is urgent
✔️ 'Issues with a Booking with a cancellation date in six months ahead' — good, no rush here
```
* Put as many issue details as you get in the request, DO NOT add inline message chains etc.
```
❌ 'I have got an issue, read that message chain for details' — a support specialist may be (and is) out of your context and will spend a lot of time to understand the issue
✔️ 'Booking HTL-AE-000001-01 stuck at status Created'
```


If anybody doesn't follow these rules, all tickets resolve slower, because support agents lose time to determine a context of a request.


## When

At this moment the support team is quite small, so ideally - at working hours and from Monday to Friday. Your request must be responded within 24 hours. All requests register in a helpdesk system as support tickets, and they don't go unnoticed. If a support specialist asks you about issue’s details and receives no answer in 7 days, a ticket closes automatically.

In addition, if you require any remote assistance (e.g., via TeamViewer) you must stay near your device, because often you must type your passwords due the process.
